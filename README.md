## How to run it

Create a docker volume to store your automated pentest reports

```

▶ docker volume create pentest-reports

```

### Now run the below commands:


```

▶ docker run -d --name pentest -d -v pentest-reports:/src vishnunair/automated-pentest

```

### Execute the pentest script inside the container like below:

```

▶ docker exec -it pentest bash

┌─[root@299c024d07ef]─[/src]
└──╼ #./pentest.sh -d example.com

```

## All the reports can be seen in /src inside the container however you can also access it from your local machine.

If your docker host is Linux, you can find Docker volumes by /var/lib/docker/volumes path.

```

▶ docker volume inspect pentest-reports

```

#### However if you're using MacOs. Try to cd /var/lib/docker/volumes from your MacOS terminal, and you'll get nothing. You see, your Mac machine isn't a real Docker host.

#### So execute the below script to access the reports from your local machine path `~/Documents/` and you can use any browser to view the reports:


```

▶ bash ./volume.sh

Check your ~/Documents/src folder for the reports

```
